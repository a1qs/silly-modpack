auto_check_update = false
| Check for new update from GitHub every time the world starts
| Default is [ true ]

auto_update = false

region_scan_percent = 75

| Default is [ 25 ]

structure_detection_size = 1
| Cancel trees if they detect structure in their area based from their size. This number will be plus with their size, higher number bigger distance. Note that this feature is not perfect, trees with long size might not be canceled. Only support number between is 0 to 9. Set to 0 for only chunks that marked as having structures. Set to -1 to disable this feature.
| Default is [ 1 ]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Living Tree Mechanics

| How many process for trees to run this system per time. Set to 0 for one time process.
| Default is [ 500 ]

living_tree_mechanics_simulation = 100
| Simulate fake trees to slowdown the process. For example, when I set tree speed for 100 trees. But there's only 1 tree in the area, it will drop and regrow leaves very fast because that's the speed for 100 trees. Set this config will simulate fake trees and make that 1 tree slowdown it process like there's 99 trees around it.
| Default is [ 100 ]
